### Overview
The objective of this analysis was to create a table of all employees, of the Pelett Hackard company, close to retiring (born in 1952-1955) and their current job title. Another objective was to create a table to display employees who would be eligible for a proposed mentorship.

### Results

#### Takeaways
- Senior Staff and Senior Engineers are the positions that have the most employees retiring
- 1,550 employees are eligible for the mentorship program
- 72,359 employees are retiring
- Only 2 managers are retiring

### Summary
As stated in the takeaway section, 72,359 positions will need to be filled as these employees retire. However, only 1,550 employees are elgibile to be in the mentorship which is most likely not enough to mentor the next generation of employees.

The table below shows the count of employees by position that are eligible to be a mentor.

This table shows the count of employees by position that are not retiring soon.

![Non Retiring Titles](https://github.com/dkristek/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/nonretirement_count.png)

This shows how few mentors there are for each position relative to the number of non retiring employees. Especially the manager position which has no eligible mentors available. This lack of mentors is a cause for concern for the company.
